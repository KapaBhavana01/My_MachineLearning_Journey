# Breast Cancer Prediction

This project aims to implement and evaluate the effectiveness of three widely used machine learning algorithms—decision trees, random forests, and XGBoost—for the classification of breast cancer. The objective is to create precise models capable of distinguishing between malignant and benign breast tumors using features extracted from digitized images of breast tissue.
